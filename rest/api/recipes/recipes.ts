This is crucial for babies since they are still growing and the development in their bones has to be supplemented with enough calcium. The same goes for pregnant women who have babies growing inside them. Actually, the tendency is that they need to take in more calcium since the fetus consumes the calcium in the mother’s body. The need for this nutrient does not stop, especially as you grow older. That is why, for both young and old, eating sufficient calcium rich foods is necessary. As we age, the bone also has the tendency to become brittle due to lack of calcium. Aside from that, we often do activities that could further promote loss of this nutrient like smoking. If there is not sufficient amount of this within an adult’s body, it could lead to osteoporosis or continuous reduction of bone density mass. The good thing is that incorporating calcium rich foods within your diet will help you prevent such health problems.","link":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/15-calcium-rich-foods-that-you-must-eat/","video":"","prep_time":"","cook_time":"","total_time":"","servings":"","calories":"","related":[],"instructions":[],"ingredients":[],"nutritions":[""],"categories":[11]},{"id":10720,"title":"Shrimp and Vegetable Fried Rice","slug":"shrimp-and-vegetable-fried-rice","description":"Shrimp and Vegetable Fried Rice is one of the fried rice recipes that I like mainly because it is a meal in itself (like the delicious yang chow fried rice which I enjoy eating).

Lechon Paksiw is a Filipino pork dish made from leftover roast pig which is known as “Lechon”. Aside from using roast pig, leftover Lechon kawali can also be used.Making this dish is a practical way to recycle leftover pork. Instead of reheating the same dish over and over, making paksiw out of it makes the pork more flavorful bringing more life to the ingredient.","image":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Lechon-Paksiw-Panlasang-Pinoy.jpg?x48120","link":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/lechon-paksiw-recipe/","video":"","prep_time":" Prep Time 10 minutes","cook_time":" Cook Time 45 minutes","total_time":" Total Time 55 minutes","servings":" Servings 8","calories":"","related":["73704","76557","75130","75382","71604","76087"],"instructions":["Heat a cooking pot and pour-in the beef stock.
