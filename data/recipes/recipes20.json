This is crucial for babies since they are still growing and the development in their bones has to be supplemented with enough calcium. The same goes for pregnant women who have babies growing inside them. Actually, the tendency is that they need to take in more calcium since the fetus consumes the calcium in the mother’s body. The need for this nutrient does not stop, especially as you grow older. That is why, for both young and old, eating sufficient calcium rich foods is necessary. As we age, the bone also has the tendency to become brittle due to lack of calcium. Aside from that, we often do activities that could further promote loss of this nutrient like smoking. If there is not sufficient amount of this within an adult’s body, it could lead to osteoporosis or continuous reduction of bone density mass. The good thing is that incorporating calcium rich foods within your diet will help you prevent such health problems.","link":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/15-calcium-rich-foods-that-you-must-eat/","video":"","prep_time":"","cook_time":"","total_time":"","servings":"","calories":"","related":[],"instructions":[],"ingredients":[],"nutritions":[""],"categories":[11]},{"id":10720,"title":"Shrimp and Vegetable Fried Rice","slug":"shrimp-and-vegetable-fried-rice","description":"Shrimp and Vegetable Fried Rice is one of the fried rice recipes that I like mainly because it is a meal in itself (like the delicious yang chow fried rice which I enjoy eating).
