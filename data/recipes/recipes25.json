It is a soft gelatin-like snack made from processed soybeans topped with caramel and tapioca pearls (locally called sago). The soft gelatin-like texture is achieved by undergoing a series of steps. Soybeans are soaked in water overnight then finely grinded and boiled. While boiling, extracts from the soy beans mixes with water forming soy milk. The remaining solid particles are placed in a cloth then squeezed tightly until all the soy milks are fully extracted. Coagulating agents such as gelatin or magnesium chloride are then added to thicken the texture. The caramel syrup is made by caramelizing brown sugar and mixing it with water.","image":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tahopic-300x164.jpg?x24723","link":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/taho-bean-curd-tofu-high-protein-food-philippine-street-food/","video":"","prep_time":"","cook_time":"","total_time":"","servings":"","calories":"","related":[],"instructions":[],"ingredients":[],"nutritions":[""],"categories":[96]},{"id":3006,"title":"Marinated Shrimp with Lemon Dill Sauce","slug":"delicious-seafood-appetizer-dish-marinated-shrimp-with-lemon-dill-sauce-recipe","description":"Marinated Shrimp with Lemon Dill Sauce is an appetizer dish that makes use of peeled semi-cooked shrimps.
