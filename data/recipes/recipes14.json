Every time we order calamari in restaurants, I am always surprised on how fast the servers get back to us with the order already with them — still hot and crunchy on the outside, while very soft in the inside. That is how a perfect calamari should be, in my opinion. I personally like the calamari fritti of Lou Malnati’s and the spicy calamari of Olive Garden is also a good one. The good news is you do not need to dine-in any restaurant to enjoy a perfectly delicious calamari appetizer. You can always make this in your home kitchen, but make sure to open the windows and vent, or else your place will smell appetizing too.","image":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Easy-Calamari.jpg?x48120","link":"https://panlasangpinoy.com/easy-calamari-recipe/","video":"","prep_time":" Prep Time 10 minutes","cook_time":" Cook Time 10 minutes","total_time":" Total Time 20 minutes","servings":" Servings 4","calories":"","related":["24269","71471","71588","71746","71897","72091"],"instructions":["Combine the flour, salt, garlic powder, and parsley flakes.

I thought that I can always get frozen fish fillets from my local grocer – and that is what I did. Mahi mahi is the fish of choice today. To those that are not familiar with this fish variety, mahi mahi is also known as dolphin fish. Hey — before anyone reacts negatively, please let me clarify that dolphin fish is just a common name given to mahi mahi; this is not a dolphin or anyway related to the cute sea creatures that we love and protect. I can assure you that no real dolphins were hurt during the filming of this video. If you feel that you don’t like to use mahi mahi to make sweet and sour fish, the choice is your.
